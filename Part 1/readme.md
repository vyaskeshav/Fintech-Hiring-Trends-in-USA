## Objective:
Financial institutions in the US are changing rapidly. Changing business models and the technological revolution has fueled the growth of a new breed of financial products and services collectively known as Fintech. With changing demographics, automation efforts and demand for new products and services, large financial institutions are realizing the power of technologies like data science, AI, cloud technologies and machine learning and are heavily investing to upgrade their technological platforms to cater to the upcoming revolution. Technology has been a key player in helping drive this revolution. In a 2017 report by CB Insights more than 46% of the job openings were in the technology section. Things are fast evolving and as we enter 2019, it is interesting to understand the hiring trends in the top financial institutions in the US. Our goal in this case study is to conduct a study on the job openings in the top US Banks in the United States and analyze trends in the industry particularly in the area of Fintech.
